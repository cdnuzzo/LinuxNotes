# LinuxNotes

Debian - then Ubuntu is based on that - then Mint is based on that.  :stuck_out_tongue:
<br>
Red Hat - Fedora is the community version
<br>
Suse - which has openSUSE
<br>
Slackware - which is the oldest that not many people use anymore
<br>
Arch - all community driven and the most bleeding edge stuff out there
<br>
Gentoo - another community one that is more involved too. Fun fact: NASDAQ runs this distro.
